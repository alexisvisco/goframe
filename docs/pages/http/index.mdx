# Server

The HTTP server is provided in the `internal/provide/provide_http.go` file. It uses the `net/http` package to create a simple HTTP server that listens on a specified port and serves requests.

Since this is code generated by the cli you can tweak the configuration as you want.

By default the server comes with a logger middleware to know what requests are being made.
