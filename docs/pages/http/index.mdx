# Server

The HTTP server is generated by the CLI in `internal/provide/provide_http.go`. It uses the `net/http` package and is wired with **FX** so it starts and stops with your application lifecycle.

You are free to adapt the server configuration or plug additional middlewares.
The only default middleware is the logger which prints one canonical line per request (see [Logger documentation](/docs/logger)).
