# Middlewares

`httpx.Chain` composes middlewares around a handler. It takes any number of `httpx.Middleware` and applies them in reverse order before executing the wrapped handler.

```go filename="router.go"
func (h *NoteHandler) CreateNote() http.HandlerFunc {
		return httpx.Chain(
			mw.ProvideUserContext
		)(func(r *http.Request) (httpx.Response, error) {
				// business logic
				return httpx.JSON.Created(nil), nil
		})
}
```

It is also convenient to have this located with your handler for testing because you are not forced to spin up the whole router to test a single handler.

You can add global middlewares in `internal/provide/provide_http.go` like the logger one.
