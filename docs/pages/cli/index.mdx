# CLI Overview

A `goframe` executable is generated in `cmd/cli/main.go`. Running `bin/goframe` gives access to project utilities like migrations, workers and code generators.

```
bin/goframe --help
```

Commands are implemented with [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). The default root command already exposes subcommands for tasks, database migrations and generators.
