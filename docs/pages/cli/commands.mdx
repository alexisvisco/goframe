# Extending the CLI

The root command is built with helpers from `rootcmd`. Use option functions to register additional commands or provide dependencies.

```go filename="cmd/cli/main.go"
cmdRoot := rootcmd.NewCmdRoot(
    rootcmd.WithCommand("task", customCmd()),
    rootcmd.WithFxOptions(fx.Provide(NewThing)),
)
```

`WithCommand` groups your command under a namespace like `task`. Tasks generated by `bin/goframe generate task` are added this way.

For now you can extends generators and tasks.
