# Generators

The `generate` command writes boilerplate for common patterns. Each generator updates the registry files so the new code is immediately usable.

```
bin/goframe generate <type> <name>
```

Available generators include:

- `handler` – add a new HTTP handler and register it
- `repository` – create a repository interface and implementation
- `service` – scaffold a service depending on repositories
- `migration` – new database migration file
- `worker` – create a workflow and activity for Temporal
- `task` – add a CLI task (see [Tasks](/docs/tasks))
- `mailer` – new mailer action with templates

Generators modify Go files to wire the new components. Review the diff and commit the changes.
