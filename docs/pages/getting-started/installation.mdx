# Installation

Install the CLI to generate a new project and run common tasks.

```bash
go install github.com/alexisvisco/goframe/cli/goframe@latest
```

Create a project in a new directory:

```bash
goframe init myapp
```

This command scaffolds the folder structure, downloads dependencies and prepares a working `main.go` entry point.
