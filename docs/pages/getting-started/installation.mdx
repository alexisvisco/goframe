# Installation

<Callout type={"info"}>GoFrame requires you to have at least **Docker** working and **Golang** installed</Callout>


Install the CLI to generate a new project and run common tasks.

```bash
go install github.com/alexisvisco/goframe/cli/goframe@latest
```



Create a project in a new directory:

```bash
goframe init <go module name> [flags]
```

There are several options you can pass:

| flag          | description                                  | default  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
| --http-server | Initialize a http application                | true     |
| --folder      | Project folder name                          | `.`      |
| --db-name     | Set the database (postgres, sqlite           | postgres |
| --orm         | Set the ORM to use (only gorm supported)     | gorm     |
| --worker      | Worker type to use (only temporal supported) | temporal |

This command scaffolds the folder structure, downloads dependencies and prepares a working `cmd/app/main.go` entry point.

## Setup external services

After the installation successful, you can setup the docker-compose file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Will setup the following services:
- postgres (if you selected `postgres` as database)
- mailpit: a simple SMTP server to test emails
- temporal: a workflow engine to run background jobs
- temporal-ui: a web interface to monitor and manage workflows

## Run the application

You can run the application using the following command:

```bash
go run cmd/app/main.go
```

## Run the CLI

GoFrame generte a CLI for you which is collocated in the directory of your application at `cmd/cli/main.go` folder. You can run it using the following command:

```bash
bin/goframe --help
```

This is with this command that you can run generators, migrations, add tasks ...
You can totally extend the CLI with your own commands, you will see how to do it in the [CLI documentation](/docs/cli).
