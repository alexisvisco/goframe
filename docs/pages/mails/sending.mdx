# Sending emails

Mailer methods start the `SendEmailWorkflow` in the background. The generated code resembles:

```go filename="mailer_welcome.go"
func (m *WelcomeMailer) SendWelcome(ctx context.Context, vars SendWelcomeParams) error {
    var wf workflow.SendEmailWorkflow
    _, err := m.client.ExecuteWorkflow(ctx, client.StartWorkflowOptions{
        ID: "mailer_" + cuid2.Generate(),
        TaskQueue: "default",
        RetryPolicy: &temporal.RetryPolicy{MaximumAttempts: 1},
    }, wf.SendEmail, mail.Message{
        To:       vars.To,
        Subject:  "SendWelcome",
        View:     "welcome_send_welcome",
        Variables: vars,
    })
    return err
}
```

Calling `SendWelcome` returns as soon as the workflow has been scheduled. The actual SMTP transaction happens inside the workflow which retries on failure.
Inside the workflow, the `SendEmailActivity` is executed with a retry policy of three attempts.
