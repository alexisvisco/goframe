# Mail Overview

Sending emails is handled asynchronously. The CLI creates a `SendEmailWorkflow` that calls the `mail.Sender` to actually deliver the message. When you invoke a mailer method it executes this workflow so the HTTP request can return immediately and retries are managed by Temporal.

A **mailer** groups related email actions. Each mailer is a simple struct with a Temporal client and methods that start the workflow with the correct message parameters.

Generate a mailer and an action with:

```bash
bin/goframe generate mailer <mailer name> <action>
```

This command creates the mailer file, the views for HTML and text formats, and updates the registry so the constructor is wired into `fx`.

See [Sending](./sending.mdx) for an example call and [Templates](./templates.mdx) for the file layout.
