# Templates

Each mail action has two template files under `views/mails`:

```
views/mails/<mailer>_<action>.mjml.tmpl
views/mails/<mailer>_<action>.txt.tmpl
```

The MJML file renders the HTML body while the text template is used for the plain text part. The `mail.Sender` loads both when building the `mail.Message`.

You can customize these templates with Go's `html/template` and `text/template` syntax.
