# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for our project! This guide will help you understand how to use the features and functionalities of the Goframe framework.

This framework will help you to design and develop web applications in Go with ease.

It provides a set of tools and libraries that simplify the development process, allowing you to focus on building your application rather than dealing with low-level details.

Also because of the codegen design everything is very easy to extend and customize for your needs.
