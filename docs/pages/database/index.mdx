# Database

GoFrame relies on [Gorm](https://gorm.io) by default to manage the connection and to give a simple API to query the database.
The generated provider returns both a `*gorm.DB` and the underlying `*sql.DB` handle. Because all the helpers only require the standard `database/sql` API, you can swap Gorm for any ORM that can work with a `*sql.DB`.

See [Connection](./connection.mdx) for how the provider is wired and [Migrations](./migrations.mdx) for keeping the schema in sync.
