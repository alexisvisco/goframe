# Database

GoFrame relies on [Gorm](https://gorm.io) for database access. The generated provider exposes a `*gorm.DB` as the main entry point and also returns the underlying `*sql.DB` handle when you really need it.

See [Connection](./connection.mdx) for how the provider is wired and [Migrations](./migrations.mdx) for keeping the schema in sync.
