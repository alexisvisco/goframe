# Migrations

Migrations live under `db/migrations` and are listed in `db/migrations.go`. They can be written in Go or plain SQL.

Create a new migration with the CLI:

```bash
bin/goframe generate migration create_users_table
```
Use `--sql` to generate a SQL migration instead of a Go one.

Run pending migrations:

```bash
bin/goframe db migrate
```

Rollback the last migration:

```bash
bin/goframe db rollback
```

You can also drop all tables with:

```bash
bin/goframe db clean
```

The migrator operates on a `*gorm.DB`, allowing migrations to participate in the same transactional context as your application code.

## When to run migration ?

Migration are ran when the application starts, this is by default added inside the db provider, but you can also run them manually.
