# Why Goframe

Goframe brings together everything you need to craft a web service in Go without giving up the simplicity of the standard library. It provides the common building blocks so you can focus on your features instead of wiring packages together.

## Goals

- **HTTP router** with middleware support
- **Database layer** that works with your favourite driver
- **Background worker** and scheduled tasks management
- **Mail** utilities for transactional emails
- **Minimal dependencies** and clean project layout

Goframe remains small on purpose. You keep full control over your code while enjoying higher level components when you need them.
