# Why GoFrame

I am a developer, I learn Go in 2018 and I have been using it ever since. I have worked on many projects, both personal and professional, and I have always found Go to be a great language for building web applications.

However, I have always felt that there was something missing in the Go ecosystem. I wanted a framework that would help me to build web applications quickly and easily, without having to do everything from scratch.

I wanted a framework that would provide me the tools and libraries I needed to build web applications.

That's why I created GoFrame. It is a framework that provides a set of tools and libraries that simplify the development process, allowing you to focus on building your application rather than dealing with decisions and low-level details.

## Goals

- Should be easy to understand and use
- Should be extendable and customizable
- Dependencies must be chosen carefully
- CLI should augment development experience
- Should be well documented
