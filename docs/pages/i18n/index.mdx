# I18n

GoFrame supports internationalization by loading translation files from `config/i18n` and generating typed helpers.
Translations are written in YAML per locale:

```yaml filename="translations.en.yaml"
welcome: "Welcome {user}"
errors:
  not_found: "Resource {code:int} not found"
```

Run `bin/goframe i18n new translations` to create the files and generate `translations.gen.go`.
The generated struct exposes methods matching the keys:

```go filename="handler.go"
t, _ := i18n.MustNewTranslations()
msg := t.Welcome(ctx, "Alice")
```

The lookup uses the `language` value from `context.Context` with the default locale from the configuration as a fallback.
Placeholders become parameters to the generated methods.

## Placeholder types

The parameter type is optional and defaults to `string`. Any valid Go type can
be used. Common examples include:

- `int`
- `float64`
- `bool`
- `[]string`

Slices are joined with a comma when substituted. Types implementing
`fmt.Stringer` will use their `String()` representation.

See [Generating](./generating.mdx) for the CLI commands.
