# GoFrame Documentation

Welcome to the GoFrame documentation! GoFrame is an opinionated framework for building web applications in Go. It provides a powerful command-line interface that scaffolds your project and manages common tasks so you can focus on business logic.

<Callout type="info">
  GoFrame is based on **file generation** - everything is generated from your code, making it easy to maintain and extend your applications.
</Callout>

## Key Features

- **üöÄ Code Generation**: Automatic scaffolding and code generation based on your specifications
- **üì¶ Modular Architecture**: Pick only the modules you need for your project
- **üõ†Ô∏è Powerful CLI**: Comprehensive command-line tools for project management
- **üéØ Developer Experience**: Focus on business logic rather than boilerplate
- **üîß Highly Customizable**: Easy to extend and adapt to your specific needs
- **üìù TypeScript Integration**: Automatic TypeScript client generation for APIs

## What's Included

GoFrame is divided into modules to allow users to pick only what they need:

### Core Modules

- **üèóÔ∏è Core Module**: Essential contracts, basic types, and helper functions
- **üóÑÔ∏è Database Module**: Database integration with GORM, migrations, and seeds
- **üåê HTTP Module**: HTTP server, routing, middleware, and client utilities
- **‚ö° Worker Module**: Background job processing with Temporal workflows
- **üìß Mail Module**: Email sending with MJML and text templates
- **üìÅ Storage Module**: File storage abstraction for disk and S3
- **‚ö° Cache Module**: Caching with optional TTL and event notifications
- **üîß CLI Module**: Code generation and project management tools

### Built-in Features

- **HTTP Server** powered by `net/http` with routing helpers
- **Middleware Support** for logging, CORS, IP detection, and rate limiting
- **Database Integration** through GORM with migration helpers
- **Internationalization** using YAML translations with typed accessors
- **Background Jobs** based on [Temporal](https://temporal.io)
- **Structured Logging** via canonical log helper built on `slog`
- **Task Runner** for reusable CLI commands
- **Authentication** helpers and utilities

## Architecture Overview

GoFrame follows a modular, dependency injection-based architecture:

- **Dependency Injection**: Built on [Uber FX](https://uber-go.github.io/fx/) for clean dependency management
- **Code Generation**: Generators create boilerplate code based on your specifications
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between HTTP handlers, services, and data layers
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based configuration with environment variable support
