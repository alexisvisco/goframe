# Mail Overview

Sending emails is handled asynchronously. The CLI creates a `SendEmailWorkflow` that runs a `SendEmailActivity` using the `mail.Sender` to deliver messages.

A **mailer** is a set of related email actions. Each mailer is a struct implementing an interface in `internal/types/mailer.go` so it can be easily mocked. The methods start the workflow with the correct message parameters.

Generate a mailer and an action with:

```bash
bin/goframe generate mailer <mailer name> <action>
```

This command creates the mailer file, the views for HTML and text formats, and updates the registry so the constructor is wired into `fx`.
