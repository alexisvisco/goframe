# Sending emails

Mailer methods start the `SendEmailWorkflow` in the background. The generated code resembles:

```go filename="mailer_welcome.go"
func (m *WelcomeMailer) SendWelcome(ctx context.Context, vars types.WelcomeMailerSendWelcomeParams) error {
    return triggerWorkflow(ctx, m.client, vars, vars.To, "SendWelcome", "welcome_send_welcome")
}
```

Calling `SendWelcome` returns as soon as the workflow has been scheduled. The actual SMTP transaction happens inside the workflow which retries on failure.
Inside the workflow, the `SendEmailActivity` is executed with a retry policy of three attempts.
