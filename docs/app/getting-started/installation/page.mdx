import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

# Installation

<Callout type={"info"}>GoFrame requires you to have at least **Docker** working and **Golang** installed</Callout>


Install the CLI to generate a new project and run common tasks.

```bash
go install github.com/alexisvisco/goframe/cli/cmd/goframe@latest
```



Create a project in a new directory:

```bash
goframe init --gomod <go module name> [flags]
```

There are several options you can pass:

| flag          | description                                  | default  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
| --gomod, -g   | Go module name (required)                    | -        |
| --folder, -f  | Project folder name                          | `.`      |
| --db-name, -d | Set the database (postgres, sqlite)         | postgres |
| --worker      | Worker type to use (only temporal supported) | temporal |
| --maintainer, -m | Add maintainer-specific testing features | false    |

This command scaffolds the folder structure, downloads dependencies and prepares a working `cmd/app/main.go` entry point.

**Example:**
```bash
goframe init --gomod github.com/myuser/myproject
```

## Setup external services

After the installation successful, you can setup the docker-compose file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Will setup the following services:
- **PostgreSQL** (if you selected `postgres` as database) - localhost:7894
- **Mailpit** - SMTP server for email testing at http://localhost:8025
- **Temporal** - workflow engine at localhost:7233
- **Temporal UI** - web interface at http://localhost:8233
- **MinIO** - object storage at http://localhost:9000 (UI at http://localhost:9001)

## Run the application

You can run the application using the following command:

```bash
go run cmd/app/main.go
```

## Run the CLI

GoFrame generates a CLI for you which is located in your application at `cmd/cli/main.go`. After building it, you can run it using:

```bash
bin/goframe --help
```
The generated CLI includes commands for:
- **Database operations**: migrations, seeds, cleanup
- **Code generation**: handlers, services, migrations, mailers, workers
- **Development tools**: route listing, sync operations, i18n management
- **Tasks**: custom task management

You can extend the CLI with your own commands. See the [CLI documentation](/docs/cli) for more details.

## Available CLI Commands

Once your project is set up, the generated CLI provides these main command groups:

- `db` - Database operations (migrate, rollback, seeds, clean)
- `generate` - Code generators (handler, service, migration, mailer, etc.)
- `task` - Task management if any
- `routes` - List application routes
- `sync` - Synchronization operations
- `i18n` - Internationalization management
- `refactor` - Code refactoring utilities
- `sync` - Synchronization operations (router, registries, mails ...)
