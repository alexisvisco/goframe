# Welcome to Goframe

Goframe is a modular Golang framework that helps you bootstrap web and background applications quickly. It draws inspiration from the productivity of frameworks like Rails or Laravel while encouraging explicit code organization.

This guide walks you through the project layout generated by the `init` command and explains each component: configuration, providers, repositories, services, handlers and more. Every topic includes examples so you can start coding right away.
