# Seeds

Database seeds populate tables with initial or test data. GoFrame executes them through the CLI and tracks which seeds already ran.

Seeds live under `db/seeds` and are listed in `db/seeds.go`.
Generate one with:

```bash
go run cmd/cli/main.go generate seed <name> [--sql]
```

Use `--sql` to create a SQL seed instead of Go code.

Run all unapplied seeds:

```bash
go run cmd/cli/main.go db seeds up
```

Applied seeds can be listed using:

```bash
go run cmd/cli/main.go db seeds show
```

Each seed implements the `seed.Seed` interface and may be grouped in a single transaction.
