# Logger

### Standard Library Logging with slog
GoFrame utilise the stdlib slog package for logging, which is a simple and efficient logging library that is part of the Go standard library. It provides a structured logging interface that allows you to log messages with different levels of severity.

You can have more information about the slog package in the blog post [Structured Logging with slog](https://go.dev/blog/slog).

In addition to that we added a canonical logger.

### What is a Canonical Log?

A canonical log is a single, comprehensive log entry that captures all the important context and events for a particular operation or request. Instead of scattered log entries throughout your application, a canonical log line accumulates relevant information during the execution of an operation and emits one complete, structured log entry at the end.
This approach, popularized by companies like Stripe, provides several benefits:

- Complete Context: All relevant information for an operation is contained in a single log entry
- Easier Debugging: No need to correlate multiple log entries across different parts of your application
- Better Analytics: Structured data makes it easier to query and analyze logs
- Reduced Log Volume: One comprehensive entry instead of many partial ones

You can read more about this concept in Stripe's blog post: [Canonical Log Lines](https://stripe.com/blog/canonical-log-lines)

### The clog Package

The clog package implements canonical logging by providing a Line type that accumulates attributes throughout the lifecycle of an operation through the context.

A little example of how to use it:

```go filename="example.go"
func HandleRequest(resp http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	// Get or create a canonical log line from context
	_, line := clog.FromContext(req.Context())

	line.Add("user_id", "12345")
	line.Add("operation", "create_order")
}
```

This will gives us

```
2025/06/14 08:52:56 INFO http request method=POST path=/v1/notes remote_addr=127.0.0.1:51104 status_code=200 duration_ms=0 user_id=12345 operation=create_order
```

<Callout type={"info"}>
Note that we ignored the context, because it serves to add the logger to the context.
In our case the logger is already added to the context by the HTTP logger middleware, so we can use it directly.
