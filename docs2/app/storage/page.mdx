# Storage

GoFrame provides a storage abstraction used to manage attachments. When running `goframe init`, the CLI creates a provider and migrations so attachments can be stored on disk or in Amazon S3.

Choose the implementation through the `storage.type` setting in `config.yml`:

```yaml
storage:
  type: s3
  bucket: "${STORAGE_BUCKET}"
  region: "${STORAGE_REGION}"
  access_key: "${STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY}"
  secret_key: "${STORAGE_SECRET_KEY}"
  endpoint: "${STORAGE_ENDPOINT}"
  secure: ${STORAGE_SECURE:true}
```

You can also use `disk` storage type in combination with the `directory` property to store attachments on the local filesystem.

Interact with the storage via the `contracts.Storage` interface:

```go
attachment, err := storage.UploadAttachment(ctx, coretypes.UploadAttachmentOptions{
    Filename: "example.png",
    Content:  file,
})

// or using a multipart.FileHeader
attachment, err := storage.UploadAttachment(ctx, coretypes.UploadAttachmentOptions{
    Filename: "example.png",
    ContentMultipartFileHeader: header,
})
```

To download an attachment you can use:

```go
reader, err := storage.DownloadAttachment(ctx, attachment.ID)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
defer reader.Close()
```

To serve attachments, register the handler in your router:

```go
router.HandleFunc("/attachments/{id}", storage.AttachmentHandler("id"))
```

You can imagine having a middleware that checks permissions before serving the attachment.
