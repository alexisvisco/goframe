# Workers

GoFrame chooses [Temporal](https://temporal.io) as the worker engine. A worker listens on a task queue and executes *workflows* and *activities*.

A **workflow** defines the orchestration of long running business logic, you can see that as job. It is durable and can pause or resume across process restarts.

An **activity** performs the actual side effects like sending emails or writing to a database. Activities are invoked from workflows and automatically retried by Temporal if they fail.

The CLI can bootstrap them for you:

```bash
bin/goframe generate worker workflow ImageCleaner CleamImage SendNotification
```

This command create a ImageCleanerWorkflow and two activities: CleanImageActivity and SendNotificationActivity.

Temporal brings several benefits:

- State persistence so workflows survive process crashes
- Automatic retries for activities
- Builtâ€‘in tooling for versioning and scheduling

So for instance image you run a workflow to clean images, an crash right after the CleanImageActivity, Temporal will process the remaining activity so for instance the SendNotificationActivity.

Check the [Temporal documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/go/core-application) for more details on how to write workflows and activities.
