# CLI Overview

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

A `goframe` executable is generated in `cmd/cli/main.go`. Running `bin/goframe` gives access to project utilities like migrations, workers and code generators.

```
bin/goframe --help
```

<Callout type="info">`bin/goframe` caches the compiled binary in `~/.goframe/&lt;module_hash&gt;/bin/goframe`. It rebuilds the CLI when `cmd/cli/main.go` changes and falls back to the previous binary after one `go mod tidy` attempt if the build fails.</Callout>

Commands are implemented with [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). The default root command already exposes subcommands for tasks, database migrations and generators.
